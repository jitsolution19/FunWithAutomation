//		Return on Equity : Preferably more than 15%. This means how much profit the company is generating on the total shareholder’s equity.
//		Return on Capital employed : More than 20%. This means how much money the company is generating on the total capital (shareholder’s equity + total debt) employed during the financial year.
//		Debt Equity Ratio : Preferably less than 1. The loans should never exceed the total equity of the company so as to be in a comfortable position. (Exceptions : Banks and NBFCs).
//		Debtor Days : The number of days required to collect money from customers. The less the number, the better it is.
//		After analyzing the above 4 fundamental factors, then look at the profit margins, debt asset ratio, EBITDA Margin, working Capital model etc.
//		After you are satisfied with the fundamentals, then proceed towards the valuation part where you have to use DCF or Discounted Cashflow Method to find the intrinsic value of the stock. Then using current valuation methods, you start accumulating the stock in your portfolio.
